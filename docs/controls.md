# Controls

Open **Escape → Options → Controls & key bindings** to customize keyboard and mouse controls. Movement, basic attack, all five skill slots, dodge, potion, interaction, portal and menu shortcuts each have primary and alternate bindings. Select either binding, then press a key or a mouse button (left, right, middle, or side buttons M4/M5). Choose **Unbind** to clear it, or Escape/Cancel to leave it unchanged. Conflicts name the existing action and require **Replace binding** before moving the binding. **Restore defaults** restores the entire default layout below.

Changes apply immediately and save automatically on this device, across characters and reloads. They do not change skill assignments or character saves, and require no progress reset. If browser storage is unavailable, the screen reports that changes apply only to this session. HUD badges, interaction prompts, inventory assignment menus and the skill atlas use the current bindings. The first available binding is shown when a primary is empty.

Bindings use physical keyboard positions. Escape remains pause/back and cancels binding capture. With Loot names set to **Hold Ctrl**, active gameplay consumes Ctrl keyboard combinations: Ctrl+S moves down while revealing loot instead of opening Save As. Menus, text fields and the Always setting retain normal browser shortcuts; Alt/Command combinations and text composition remain native. Browser/OS-reserved shortcuts that are not delivered to the page cannot be overridden. Tab and ordinary menu navigation keys retain their native behavior in panels. Mouse wheel zoom and left-click interaction with nearby objects remain available. The Controller tab documents the fixed gamepad layout; touch and controller input are independent of keyboard/mouse remapping.

## Default keyboard and mouse layout

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| WASD / arrow keys | Move |
| Mouse | Aim |
| Mouse wheel over the world | Smooth camera zoom in / out |
| Hold left mouse | Repeat the basic weapon attack |
| Right mouse / 1–4 | Use assigned skills; empty slots do nothing |
| E / click a nearby NPC, town anchor or event object | Open services, use anchors or interact with a POI |
| P / portal control below minimap | Cast town portal outside sanctuary; locate your return portal while in sanctuary |
| C / I | Character, equipment, inventory, and attributes |
| T | Skill tree and active skill assignments |
| J / mini log below minimap | Open or close Journeys; Track explicitly pins an activity |
| Space | Dodge, using one of two regenerating charges |
| Q | Dual potion: restores life and mana; charges return through kills |
| Escape | Close a panel, pause, or resume |
| M | Open or close the world map |
| Tab while playing / click minimap | Open the world map |
| Map: drag / scroll / + and − | Pan / zoom |
| N | Toggle synthesized sound |
| F3 | Frame-rate and coordinate overlay |

A town portal channels for three seconds. Movement, damage, attacking, skills, dodge, Escape, P again or leaving the gameplay input context cancels it. It costs nothing and refills nothing. E/click the town endpoint returns once to your departure point.

Unlock skills in the tree, then assign them to the five skill slots (RMB or 1–4 by default). Empty slots do nothing. Character, inventory, skill tree, Journeys, map and town-service panels pause combat.

In shops, select an item and Buy/Sell, or Shift-click for a direct trade. The Equipped section at the blacksmith or enchanter upgrades worn gear in place. Escape closes the service.

The edit icon beside **Equipment** opens the Character/Armor editor directly. Save changes applies the saved look; Cancel, Escape or controller B discards the draft and returns to inventory. The live preview stays visible while editing. In the editor, LB/RB selects Character/Armor; D-pad/left stick moves through option grids and A selects. In Armor, double-click or long-press any color swatch, including Original (touch/pointer or controller A) to open **Apply color to all parts?** Confirm applies it to every armor part; Cancel/Escape/B closes that prompt only.

In the inventory, hover/focus inspects, double-click equips a bag item, Enter/Space or Shift-click equips/unequips, and drag/drop moves or equips items. The first icon beside Inventory opens Sort & filter; the second runs Equip Best by item power. A different best weapon type asks: Equip anyway, Keep current weapon only (upgrade other gear), or Cancel. The sort/filter popover organizes the whole bag by rarity, type or recent pickup and combines type and rarity filters. Escape or B closes a popup before the inventory. In the tree, single-click inspects; double-click or Allocate path spends points on the complete highlighted route if affordable. Wheel zooms and dragging pans the atlas.

## Gamepad

Inventory sort priorities are Rarity → Type → Recent pickup, Type → Rarity → Recent pickup, and Recent pickup → Rarity → Type. Select multiple type or rarity filters by toggling their buttons; All clears that group. Both groups combine, and the complete bag grid stays visible even when no items match.

Connect a controller, focus the local game, press a button so the browser exposes it, then release the buttons and center both sticks. Controllers exposed with the browser's [standard Gamepad mapping](https://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/#remapping) are supported; unmapped devices are ignored. Labels use Xbox positions: A/B/X/Y correspond to the bottom/right/left/top face buttons (Cross/Circle/Square/Triangle on PlayStation).

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left stick | Analog movement; also faces movement direction when the right stick is centered |
| Right stick | Aim independently; stick tilt sets the ground-target distance from 60 to 280 world units |
| RT / R2 (hold) | Repeat basic attack |
| LT / L2 | Assigned RMB skill; holding repeats |
| RB / R1, X / Square, Y / Triangle, right-stick click | Assigned skills 1–4, once per press |
| B / Circle | Dodge |
| LB / L1 | Dual potion |
| A / Cross | Interact with nearby NPC, portal anchor or POI |
| D-pad left / right | Character and inventory |
| D-pad up | Skill atlas |
| D-pad down | Town portal |
| View / Share | Open or close the world map |
| Menu / Options | Pause/resume or close a panel; cancel an active portal channel |

The HUD's small bindings follow the active input device. Stick deadzones suppress drift and preserve analog movement speed. Releasing both sticks retains the last facing; touch/controller aim selects a nearby visible enemy within a 56-degree forward cone, with a modest retention bias to prevent flickering between neighbours. Ranged actions receive bounded motion prediction; released projectiles never home. Ground and self-targeted skills retain manual placement, and mouse aim remains cursor-local. Skills still require unlocking, assignment and compatible equipment.

In menus, use D-pad/left stick to navigate and A to activate. LB/RB move through focusable controls. B closes gameplay panels/resumes pause and cancels the character hall's delete confirmation. In the character/inventory window, LB/RB instead switches Equipment, Inventory and Attributes section tabs with remembered focus; D-pad/left stick moves spatially between cells and buttons, A/X equips or unequips, and A operates Equip Best, sorting, filters and attribute buttons. A compact LB/RB rail names and highlights the active section. On handheld-sized controller screens, Equipment, Inventory and Stats each use the full body width; section changes restore focus and scroll it into view. In shops, select an item with A, then focus and activate the ordinary purchase/sale/upgrade button. On the focused map or skill-atlas canvas, D-pad pans the map or inspects connected stars; LT/RT zoom out/in. Select fields change with left/right; up/down moves to the next control. In the skill atlas, LB/RB switches Tree, Node and Skills. A on a star focuses its node actions; X jumps to the pinned five-slot skill bar. With an unlocked skill inspected, select a slot and press A to assign it; the slot labels show LT, RB, X, Y and RS. The small × clears an assignment. The right stick scrolls the Node inspector; rank, specialization and upgrade controls remain in that inspector. B closes the panel.

Character names and search text still use a keyboard. Inventory drag/drop and gameplay camera zoom remain mouse controls. This is an initial fixed controller layout; controller remapping, rumble and an on-screen keyboard are not implemented. Hardware compatibility and combat feel await player testing.

Pause, panels, focus loss and travel clear controller actions and require neutral sticks/released buttons before accepting input again. Disconnecting the active controller pauses combat. Keyboard/mouse input takes over when used; no character save format or progress reset is involved.

POI openings take one second (beacons: two). Movement, combat, damage or leaving play cancels the channel. Choice windows pause combat; selecting a choice resumes play before the channel.

## Touch

Touch devices have a left analog movement disc and a right hold/drag attack pad, five visible skill buttons, potion, dodge, interaction and portal controls. Drag an aimed skill and release to cast, or release over Cancel. Self-centered skills can be tapped. Maps and the skill tree support pan/pinch and tap inspection. Inventory uses tap-to-inspect with Equip, Unequip and Move actions. Pause includes sound and camera zoom controls. Mouse, keyboard and gamepad bindings above remain available unchanged; typing into a native field keeps touch mode active. See [Touch gameplay and interface](touch-controls.md) for complete workflows and verification boundaries.

## AYN Thor

The Android APK uses the same controller layout through native joystick/button input. The lower screen has Map, Pack and Build tabs. Tap gear to inspect and equip while gameplay continues. Back or B closes the item without dodging or changing the pause state; Start pauses manually. Equip, Journey tracking and portal actions use the existing game commands. See [Android/Thor setup](android-thor.md).

On the character hall, D-pad/left stick navigates the slot grid spatially and updates the preview. A on a saved slot loads that character immediately; A on an empty slot focuses creation. Pending portrait reads do not block loading, and title confirmation/busy/sign-in guards still apply.
